## Learning Objectives

### Test

When I began my co-op placement, I was hoping to expand my computer science knowledge, as well as my understanding of corporate structure. As my placement comes to an end, I would say that I was success in both of these areas.

With respect to computer science, I was somewhat disappointed initially. Being the first co-op student that the department had ever hired, my role was loosely defined. And given that the team is relatively abstracted from technical work, there was not much code to be written. But with time, I found ways to improve workflows. Little bits of code here and there to make people's lives easier. 

One of my teammates had a long list of documents which they consistently referenced. I created an excel program that listed all of the items in the documents. So, instead of trying to remember which items belongs to which documents, they can now type in an item number and the program will list the documents that contain that item. It was a small thing, but it was a good refresher in excel and taught me how to take user requirements and translate that into a working program.

As for working inside of a large corporation, that was something that I had no experience in. My last co-op was at a comparatively small company with around 100 employees. So, transitioning to a multi-national corporation with nearly 100,000 employees was quite the jump. 

The biggest challenge I faced was running into a lot of bureaucracy and tasks sometimes took a while longer than they would have at a smaller company. There would be times I was told to contact someone, only for them to tell me to instead contact another person. While initially frustrating, I soon realized that this is relatively common in large organizations and learning how to handle it and get what I need is a very useful skill. Over time, I got better at this and the delays shrunk as I learned who to reach out to when I needed something.

Overall, it was a really good learning experience and I will be carrying all of this knowledge forward with me in my future endeavours. 

## Work Term Reflection

My experience at Sanofi was invaluable and greatly reaffirmed my academic goals. Despite not being a coding-focused position, I saw the need for people that are able to turn ideas into code. Until AI gets significantly better (30+ years), I feel pretty safe in my career path. 

This won't affect my academic courses too much next semester as work & school utilize very different skill sets. While I may not have the greatest memory, thus making exams more difficult, I'm very good at applying concepts that I am able to reference. Where my placement will help me is in organization. I had a lot of tasks that I was responsible for and found many strategies that helped keep me on top of things. Taking that knowledge with me will be incredibly beneficial and ensure I don't fall behind on my course work.

As I finish up my final week, I have been writing out a reference document for my successor in order to help them succeed during their placement. This included incredibly specific details on how to complete the weekly tasks as well as general information I wish I had known when I began.

In a more general sense, I would suggest that students shouldn't be afraid to ask questions. Your manager was once starting their first week and probably had a lot of the same questions. In addition, a list of acronyms is incredibly useful. Most companies use many different ones and each team will as well. The sooner you learn these, the better.

To students who are considering enrolling in co-op, my only piece of advice is: go for it. Yes, it may take an extra year or so to graduate, but having the experience of real work puts you at a huge advantage over most people applying for jobs after graduation. Companies will be less hesitant to hire you if you've worked somewhere before. The learning curve will generally be smaller and thus less work on their part. It's a win-win for everyone.

If I could give my manager advice, it would be to try and streamline the on-boarding process. My first few weeks were somewhat chaotic, mostly due to covid. He had started in the role a few months before my arrival and was figuring everything out along side me. After the first month, work went quite smoothly and I had a great time.

| S        | While completing one of my weekly tasks towards the end of the day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| T        | A particular customer was questioning the validity of my work in front of my manager's manager.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| A        | After being questioned on a certain data point, I went through and spent an extra hour re-doing my task in order to make sure I did everything correctly. I went slow and took my time to make sure I didn't make any errors. It was incredibly stressful, but I believed in my work and sent the data out. |
| R        | Afterwards, the customer agreed that I was correct and didn't ask for any more verification. While it was initially a scary situation, I remained calm and did quality work. Both my manager and manager's manager saw and later remarked on how well I handled the situation.                              |

| S        | During a meeting to discuss test results from a lab.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| T        | I was the note taker for this meeting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| A        | Before the meeting, I setup my computer to make sure I got all of the notes and didn't miss any points. I had zoom on one side and Word on the other. As the meeting was happening, I took point-form notes of everything that was said and then expanded on them after the meeting had concluded. |
| R        | Once I had expanded my notes, I sent them off to the attendees and they subsequently used them in their daily work. By using these strategies, the other teams had good notes to reference and didn't waste time and resources re-clarifying points already discussed in the meeting.              |

| S        | During our first weekly team meeting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| T        | Trying to understand everything that was being said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| A        | While the meeting was happening, I was trying to take in all of the vocabulary that was being used: a lot of acronyms and words I didn't recognize. After about two minutes, I opened up a document and started writing down everything that I didn't understand. Afterwards, I looked them up in the company knowledge base and asked teammates about the ones I couldn't find. |
| R        | By doing what I did, I learned a lot of now terms that would come up on a near-daily basis as well as made connections with my co-workers. It was a good way to bond with people that I didn't know particularly well and had never met in person. Afterwards, I felt a lot more integrated into the company which helped for the remainder of my placement.                     |
