## Self Evaluation

### Team Interaction

Overall, my team worked very well together. From the start, certain members took on leadership roles and were very good at organizing the team. During the simulation, some people spoke more than others, but that is normal. Those of whom that kept quiet were always asked for their input before any decisions were made.

### Lessons Learned

I've learned, once again, that working in a group is not easy. When there is no oversight or individual responsibility, it's hard to get things done. If someone isn't pulling their weight, there is not much I can do besides reminding them to do it. Thankfully everyone got their section done.

### My Contributions

My main contributions were the "Customer Service and Compliance" section, as well as editing the video together. Additionally, I proofread, edited, and formatted the majority of the document.

### Areas of Improvement

#### Personal Strengths

1. Technical Ability: Being a comp sci major, I was able to lend my skills for the recording the presentation and editing of it. 

2. Punctuality: I pride myself on being on-time and was almost always the first one to join meetings.

#### Team Strengths

1. Collaboration: When we were on a call together, everyone had plenty of ideas and vision for how we wanted to run the insurance company.

2. Delegation: Splitting up work was very easy and everyone completed their respective sections before the deadlines.

#### Personal Improvements

1. Leadership: In group projects like these, I need to take more leadership initiative. I think by taking a more active roll, it would benefit me in my future if I happen to hold positions of management.

2. Patience/Communication: I often get frustrated when deadlines are set and group members don't meet them. I instead need to step back and talk to my group mates and discuss how we can get the work done.

#### Team Improvements

1. Punctuality: Members would show up to meetings considerably late without notice when dates had been set long in advance.

2. Preparedness: Members would show up to meetings unprepared. For example, on the zoom call to record our presentation, some members had not even thought about what they were going to say. This led to the meeting being split in two and taking over 2 hours. Had everyone been prepared, this should have taken 30 minutes.
