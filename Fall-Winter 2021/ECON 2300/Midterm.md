## Notes

#### Numeraire Good

Given an equation $ax_1+bx_2=c$ and numeraire good $x_n$, the budget line can be rewritten as $\frac{ax_1+bx_2}{x_n} = \frac{c}{x_n}$ 

#### Transitivity

- Jaden likes apples more than bananas, $b < a$

- Jaden likes oranges more than apples, $a < o$

- Jaden must like oranges more than bananas, $b < a <o \equiv a<o$.

#### Utility Functions

Given a utility function $u = ax+by$, Jaden is willing to trade $x$ units of $b$ for $y$ units of $a$. This is a *perfect substitute*.

#### Indifference Curves

* The slope at point $p$ is the amount that one is willing to pay for an addition unit of item $x$.

#### Margin Rate of Substitution

$$
MRS = -\frac{MU_{x_1}}{MU_{x_2}} ~~~~~~~~~~
MU_x = \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = p_x
$$

$$
MRS(x_1^a x_2^b) = - \frac{ax_2}{bx_1} ~~~~~~~~~~
MU_{x_1} = \frac{ax_2^b}{x_1^{(1-a)}} ~~~~~~~~~~
MU_{x_2} = \frac{bx_1^a}{x_2^{(1-b)}}
$$
